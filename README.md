# BankDash: Banking Dashboard Simulation

A frontend-focused banking dashboard simulation built with **Remix v2** to explore dynamic data handling, responsive design and framework itself. Designed for learning purposes, not real-world banking.

| Info: |
| :--- |
|Most of the banking data is mocked on the backend.|
|Only single user avaiable - default credentials are: `mdawson98` / `password1234!`.|
|Design adapted from [Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1323695683687017923) (made by [Seju](https://www.figma.com/@sejal_ui_ux)) with some modifications.|
